# WhiteOps Toolkit

This repo contains two folders :

- Decrypt which contains script to decode the OZ_SG string sent by WhiteOps.
- ProofOfConcept which contains an (uncomplete) script bypass WhiteOps during the SoundCloud login.

I've also made a [nice WebApp](https://amasuyer.dev/whiteops-decode) that will give you useful informations about most of the properties that WhiteOps antibot is checking.

If you'd like more informations you can check my [blog articles](https://blog.amasuyer.dev/soundcloud-web-login-reverse-engineering) or [contact me](https://amasuyer.dev/contact-me).
